# Near Task Creator

- Near Task Creator is a NEAR blockchain based dApp which which includes creation of Task for users
- This Near Task Creator dApp it consists of a Smart Contract and it is witten in assembly script.
- Ultimately, the purpose of this project was to build a simple contract to explore how contract calls interact when building on the NEAR ecosystem.

### Functionality

#### This Near Task Creator includes following functionality :

- Manager login with Near Wallet
- Manager create task for users
- Task Dashboard
- User get the Task Allocated message in their Near wallet
- User get account-ID, Task Heading, Task Description in message
- Logout

### Smart Contracts Used In Project

#### Change Method

```bash
addTasks
```

#### Send Method

```bash
Task_Allocated
```

#### View Method

```bash
getTasks
```

```bash
  export function addTasks(assigne:string, Description:string, Task_heading:string): void {
   // Create Task logic
  }

  export function Task_Allocated(account:string, Taskheading:u128):void {
  // Send Task logic
  }

  export function getTasks(user:string):string[] {
   // View Task logic
  }

```

### Quick Start

#### To run this project locally:

- Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] â‰¥ 12
- Clone this repository
- Go to the project folder
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Run the local development server: `yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
  full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet!

Go ahead and play with the app and the code. As you make code changes, the app will automatically reload.

### Exploring The Code

- The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder.
- The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
  place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/assets/js/index.js`, where you
  can connects frontend to the NEAR blockchain.
- Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
  contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested. The frontend
  code gets tested with [jest]. You can run both of these at once with `yarn run test`.

### Installation -

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][near accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.

### Step 1: Install near-cli (optional)

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

### Step 2: Create an account for the contract

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`:

- Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:
  ```bash
      near login
  ```
- Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):
  ```bash
     near create-account near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet
  ```
